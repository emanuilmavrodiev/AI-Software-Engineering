# Elegant Cuts - Static Site

This folder contains a small static website for a hairdresser salon.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page with header, navigation, hero, services, about, contact and footer.
- `styles.css` — responsive styles.
- `script.js` — mobile nav toggle and simple contact form handling.
- `script.js` — mobile nav toggle, contact form handling and gallery lightbox.

How to run:
Open `index.html` in your browser. On macOS you can run:

```bash
open "1.Git, GitHub, and Web Application Deployment/hairdresser-site/index.html"
```

Notes:
- This is a static prototype. To receive form submissions you should wire the form to a backend or a service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your own API).
- Replace placeholder links (Instagram, Privacy) with real targets.

Gallery:
- The site includes a small wallpaper gallery using images from Unsplash (hotlinked). Replace the image URLs in `index.html` with local images if you want the site to work fully offline.
